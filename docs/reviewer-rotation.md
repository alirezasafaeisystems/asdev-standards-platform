# Reviewer Rotation Policy (CODEOWNERS)

## Goal
Avoid review bottlenecks by rotating reviewers for CODEOWNERS-owned paths.

## Policy (simple)
- Prefer at least 2 owners for critical paths (when possible)
- Use a weekly "Primary" + "Backup" reviewer per area
- Primary owns response time; Backup covers absences

## Template
Week of: YYYY-MM-DD
- Area A: Primary @user1 | Backup @user2
- Area B: Primary @user3 | Backup @user4

## Note
CODEOWNERS enforcement stays strict; rotation is an operational policy.
